2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`

4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D

Don't edit files under `dist` folder, those are generated after running `gulp` command, edit files under `src` folder instead.

Also remember to follow the [style guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide).
